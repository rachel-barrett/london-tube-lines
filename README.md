This project aims to be a minimal rest service, that could serve as a template for other rest services.

Things I aim to achieve/ experiment with in this template
* Identification of the best modern scala libraries to use
* No difficult to understand implicits passed around like ActorSystem and ActorMaterializer
* Initialise everything functionally, including config
* Better unit testing of route layer
* No cake
* Co-location of entities and services
